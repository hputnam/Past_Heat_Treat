# Effects of thermal conditioning of swimming Porites astreoides larvae on subsequent physiological performance

Q1: What is the effect of thermal stress on larval performance?   
Q2: What is the carryover of thermal stress on larvae to the juvenile stages?   
Q3: Does repeat thermal stress across juvenile stages affect performance?
