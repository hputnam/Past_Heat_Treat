This code analyzes the pulse amplitude fluometry (PAM) data that was collected from P. asteriodes larvae and spat in Bermuda 2023. 

## Set up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)
```

First, I am going to analyze the data from the larval samples. 

## Load data 
```{r}

```
